# AirlineOnTime

## Project McNulty
This project is a supervised machine learning program. The goal of the Machine Learning algorithm is to predict whether your flight will be delayed. 

### Data Sources
[Bureau of Transportation](https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/bts-publications/airline-service-quality-performance-234-time)

[Weather.gov](weather.gov) Has data but it seems hard to grab because of the segmentation

* Ohare.get_outbound_delays()
